== 28/5/07: Fixed Ubuntu build ==

I checked in a patch by Grahame Bowland that fixes the build on Ubuntu. I also removed some generated files that should not be part of the repository. I noticed that make check fails because the register test was incomplete; I've fixed the test, but it's still failing and I don't know why right now. I'll look into it later. Thanks Grahame!

Update: I found the problem with registers.check and checked in a fix. "make check" should pass fine now.

== 22/5/07: Subversion repository created ==

I have checked the sources into Subversion (see the Source tab). This is basically the same as the initial tarball, but I have added a couple of small fixes (one to clean up spurious error messages when a process is forked, one to allow Chronicle to build on systems where gelf.h is in /usr/include instead of /usr/include/libelf).
