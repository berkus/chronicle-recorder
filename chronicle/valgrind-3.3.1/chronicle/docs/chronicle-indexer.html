<h1>The <tt>chronicle-indexer</tt> Tool</h1>

<p>Normally <tt>chronicle-indexer</tt> is spawned internally by the Chronicle Valgrind tool. It can be
run manually for testing and debugging.

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

<p><strong><tt>CHRONICLE_DB</tt></strong> When set to a file name, <tt>chronicle-indexer</tt> will store
the indexed, compressed database in this file. This variable is normally set to something. When not set,
no database is generated.

<p><strong><tt>CHRONICLE_SAVE</tt></strong> When set to a file name, <tt>chronicle-indexer</tt>
will save the raw trace packets received by the Chronicle Valgrind tool to the specified file. This is useful
for later playback and analysis. <em>WARNING</em>, this data is not compressed so the generated file sizes
can be huge!

<p><strong><tt>CHRONICLE_NO_SAVE_DATABASE_NAME</tt></strong> When set, the generated database name is not
saved to <tt>~/.chronicle-databases</tt>. Otherwise it is. This should be set while running tests.

<h2>Command-line Parameters</h2>

<p><strong><tt>--input</tt></strong> Read the trace to be indexed and compressed
from standard input (into which should be piped a trace packet dump generated by <tt>CHRONICLE_SAVE</tt>,
see above). When not specified, trace data is accessed via shared memory (negotiated with the Chronicle
Valgrind tool).

<p><strong><tt>--print</tt></strong> Pretty-print the raw trace data. <em>WARNING</em>, this can output
colossal volumes of data!
