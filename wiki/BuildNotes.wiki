= Build =

Chronicle is packaged as a modified Valgrind. It requires a few devel packages to be installed. Packages you might need, depending on distro:
 * libc6-dev (Ubuntu)
 * libc6-dev-i386 (Ubuntu 64-bit)
 * libelf (SUSE)
 * elfutils-libelf-devel (Red Hat)
 * libelfg0-dev (Ubuntu)

Check it out from Subversion trunk (do not download the initial code drop, since it is very old and won't work), and then
{{{
cd valgrind-3.3.1
./configure && make
}}}

(You may find it convenient to use "configure --prefix=/my/dir" to install Chronicle's valgrind somewhere other than the default Valgrind location.)

To run the Chronicle tests,
{{{
make check
}}}

To apply Chronicle to your own program,
{{{
make install
CHRONICLE_DB=/tmp/ls.db valgrind --tool=chronicle ls
chronicle-query --db /tmp/ls.db
}}}

Chronicle is currently based on Valgrind 3.3.1. Chronicle requires the x86 or AMD64 architectures on Linux, but should be fairly easy to port to any platform Valgrind itself supports.
