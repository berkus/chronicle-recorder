#summary Notes on getting Chronicle to build and work

= Build Issues =

There is no configure script. Chronicle doesn't depend on much and it only runs on Linux with gcc right now. It should build and run on any Linux system with gcc, providing the following packages are installed:
 * libelf

Just download it (or check out from Subversion) and run "make" in the Chronicle directory. Run "make check" to verify that it actually works.

Chronicle requires the x86 or AMD64 architectures.

= Running Chronicle =

I create a wrapper script `chronicle` that looks like this:
{{{
#!/bin/sh

PATH=/home/roc/chronicle:$PATH VALGRIND_LIB=/home/roc/chronicle/valgrind/.in_place /home/roc/chronicle/valgrind/coregrind/valgrind --tool=chronicle $*
}}}
(This assumes Chronicle has been built in `/home/roc/chronicle`...) Then just run `chronicle --db /tmp/myrun.db ...program and arguments`. This should run the program as normal (but rather slowly) and leave a (large) database file in /tmp/myrun.db.
