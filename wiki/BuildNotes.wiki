#summary Notes on getting Chronicle to build and work

= Build =

Chronicle is packaged as a modified Valgrind. It requires a few devel packages to be installed. Packages you might need, depending on distro:
 * libc6-dev (Ubuntu)
 * libc6-dev-i386 (Ubuntu 64-bit)
 * libelf (SUSE)
 * elfutils-libelf-devel (Red Hat)
 * libelfg0-dev (Ubuntu)

Check it out from Subversion trunk (do not download the initial code drop, since it is very old and won't work). Then, to install it in $HOME/bin,
{{{
cd valgrind-3.3.1
./configure --prefix=$HOME && make install
}}}

Then to run the Chronicle tests,
{{{
make check
}}}

To apply Chronicle to your own program,
{{{
CHRONICLE_DB=/tmp/ls.db valgrind --tool=chronicle ls
}}}

To start chronicle-query and issue JSON queries:
{{{
chronicle-query --db /tmp/ls.db
}}}

Ordinarily you would not start chronicle-query directly, but instead use a higher-level tool such as [http://code.google.com/p/chronomancer Chronomancer].

Chronicle is currently based on Valgrind 3.3.1. Chronicle requires the x86 or AMD64 architectures on Linux, but should be fairly easy to port to any platform Valgrind itself supports.
