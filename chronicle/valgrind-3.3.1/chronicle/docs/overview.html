<h1>The Chronicle Tracing Infrastructure</h1>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>There are four key components:
  <dl>
    <dt>Tracer
    <dd>The tracer instruments a running program and logs memory and register changes, plus
some other events, into a shared memory buffer
    <dt>Indexer
    <dd>The indexer process consumes the log and builds a) compressed indices that map
space x time to events (reads, writes, executes) and b) a log of register change events,
punctuated by full register dumps
    <dt>Query Processor
    <dd>Provides an asynchronous stream API for reconstructing the memory/register
state of the program at any time, and also examining the indexes themselves
    <dt>Application
    <dd>Provides a debugging user interface which communicates with the query processor
  </dl>
