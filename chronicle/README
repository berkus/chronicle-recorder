Licensing
=========

Valgrind is under the GPL. The Valgrind 'chronicle' tool's main.c file
is also under the GPL. The tool's headers --- arch.h, log_stream.h, and
effects.h --- use an X11 license, so they can be included by anyone. The
Chronicle 'indexer' and 'query' components are GPLed. They rely on a
'base' component whose files have an X11 license (including a simple C
JSON library).

The intent is that the individual Chronicle components are GPLed but
since they run in separate processes communicating via clearly defined
interfaces, non-GPLed code can communicate with them. In particular,
debugger front ends can use any license.
