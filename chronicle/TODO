Protocol Extensions
===================

Add protocol command to read source file contents.

Query Engine Optimizations
==========================

Cache decompressed data blocks.

Cache computed line number tables.

Cache checkpoints of register state during register replay, so that register
queries for nearby timestamps can execute efficiently.

Record which types have been sent back to the client; when the client requests
the details of a type which is equivalent to an already-sent type, return
an alias to the previously sent type. This will help a lot since the same
types are repeated with different IDs in each compilation unit.

Fix threading issues and allow multithreaded querying!

Cleanup
=======

Use bsearch instead of hand-coded binary search.
