  <title>Chronicle Query Protocol</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>The Chronicle Query Protocol</h1>

<p>Messages are exchanged between a debugger and the query agent
over a bidirectional stream. In the simplest configuration the query
agent is spawned as a subprocess and messages are exchanged on its
standard input and output.

<p>Each message is a <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a> value in
ASCII. Messages are delimited by single UNIX newlines ('\n'). Every
message contains an <tt>id</tt> field identifying the query (see
below). All debugger messages contain a <tt>cmd</tt> field identifying
the type of message.

<h2>Queries</h2>

<p>The debugger initiates queries. The agent returns query results
incrementally and asynchronously. The agent also returns progress
indication. The debugger can cancel running queries. There can be
many queries running simultaneously.

<p>Every message includes an <tt>id</tt> field containing a unique
integer identifier for the query. The debugger chooses the identifiers
when it sends messages that initiate queries.

<p>The debugger may send messages with command <tt>cancel</tt>. A
cancel message requests termination of the the query with the given
<tt>id</tt>. Cancel requests on queries that are not running are
ignored.

<p>The agent's messages to the debugger contain an <tt>id</tt> field
identifying the query. They may also contain <tt>progress</tt> and
<tt>progressMax</tt> fields with integer values; progressMax is an
estimate of the overall duration of the query, and progress is an
estimate of how far through that duration the agent is. They may also
contain a <tt>terminated</tt> string field; if 'normal' then the query
finished normally, if 'cancel' it was cancelled by the debugger, if
'error' then it terminated due to error.

<h2>Informational Messages</h2>

<p>The query agent may send messages not associated with any query.
These messages may or may not have a query <tt>id</tt> field. They contain
a field <tt>message</tt> with a string code identifying the message.
They also contain a <tt>severity</tt> field with one of the following
values:
<ul>
<li><tt>info</tt>: this message is for informational/debugging use
only. The user's attention is not required.
<li><tt>warning</tt>: the user should be warned something may be wrong,
but the system is not definitely in error.
<li><tt>error</tt>: a nonfatal error has occurred and the query (if any)
will be terminated.
<li><tt>fatal</tt>: a fatal error has occurred and the query agent
will exit.
</ul>
There will also be a <tt>text</tt> field containing English text
describing the message. Depending on the message, there may be other fields.
There may be an <tt>errno</tt> field containing a system error code and
a <tt>errnotext</tt> field explaining that error code.

<h2>Basic Information</h2>

<p>The command name <tt>info</tt> identifies the basic information
query. There are no other parameters.

<p>The result value for info queries contains various fields:
<ul>
<li>String <tt>arch</tt> returns "amd64" or "x86".
<li>String <tt>endian</tt> returns "little" or "big".
<li>Array <tt>maps</tt> returns a list of the supported map names
(strings) for this database.
<li>Integer <tt>endTStamp</tt> returns the timestamp for the end
of execution --- i.e., all executed instructions have timestamps
less than endTStamp.
</ul>

<h2>Reads</h2>

<p>Read queries obtain the values of memory or registers at a given
timestamp.

<p>The command name <tt>readMem</tt> identifies a memory read
query. <tt>readReg</tt> identifies a register read query.

<p>Read queries contain a <tt>TStamp</tt> field with the desired
integer timestamp value.

<p>Memory read queries contain a <tt>ranges</tt> field identifying the
memory to examine.  This is an array of range objects. Each range object
contains integer fields <tt>start</tt> and <tt>length</tt> describing
the virtual addresses of interest.

<p>Register read queries contain one field for each desired
register. The field has the name of the register. The names are
architecture-specifc except that "pc" always refers to the program
counter and "thread" also gives the current thread ID (a synthetic
token). Register names for x86 and AMD64 are:
<ul>
<li>General purpose registers "eax", "ebx", "ecx", "edx", "ebp", "esp",
"esi" and "edi" (x86) or their "r" variants (AMD64)
<li>"r8" to "r15" (AMD64)
<li>"xmm0" to "xmm7" (x86) or "xmm15" (AMD64)
<li>"fp0" to "fp7"
<li>"fptop", an integer pseudo-register denoting the "top of stack"
in the FP register array
<li>MMX register values are available in the FP register array.
</ul>
The value of each register field denotes the number of low-order bits
required from the register --- 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128. If no register
fields are specified then the query returns all bits of all available
registers. The values are encoded in big-endian hexadecimal strings.

<p>For memory reads, each result value gives the contents of a memory
range. Result values contain three fields: integer <tt>start</tt> with
a address, integer <tt>length</tt> with a length and optionally
<tt>bytes</tt> which is a string of hexadecimal byte values without
separators. The string length will be two times <tt>length</tt>. If the
<tt>bytes</tt> field is not present, then the memory range was unmapped
or otherwise inaccessible at that time. The memory ranges returned may not
correspond exactly to the ranges requested; the only guarantee is that
if the query terminates normally then the union of the ranges returned
equals the union of the ranges requested.

<p>For register reads, each result value gives the contents of one or
more registers. The register name is the field name and the corresponding
field value is a string of hex digits, in big-endian (MSB first) format,
up to the number of requested bits or the natural width of the
register, whichever is smaller.

<h2>Scans</h2>

<p>Scan queries search <em>maps</em> for program events. Each event
has a timestamp and an affected memory range. Some maps supply
additional data for each event. The following maps are defined:
<ul>
<li><tt>INSTR_EXEC</tt>: Each event is the execution of a program
instruction. The affected memory range is the bytes of the instruction.
<li><tt>MEM_WRITE</tt>: Each event is a write to program memory.
The affected memory range is the memory written. Each event also
supplies the data written. In some cases (e.g., system calls)
large quantities of data will be written in one event.
<li><tt>MEM_READ</tt>: Each event is a read from program memory.
The affected memory range is the memory read. This map can be
disabled at trace generation time so may not be available. The
list of available maps is given by the <tt>info</tt> query.
In some cases (e.g., system calls) large quantities of data will
be read in one event.
<li><tt>ENTER_SP</tt>: Each event is the execution of a
instruction transferring control to a function (normally a 'call'
instruction but tail calls using jumps are also detected). The
affected memory range is one pointer-size at the current value
of the stack pointer <em>after the call</em>.
<li><tt>MEM_MAP</tt>: Each event is a change to the process's
memory map. The affected memory range is the memory mapped,
unmapped or remapped. Each event has additional data describing the
map operation. In some cases a MEM_MAP event is associated with
one or more MEM_WRITE events describing the contents of the memory
that has been mapped.
</ul>
Multiple events with the same map and timestamp can occur. Sometimes
events can be `gmented, e.g., a write that straddles a page boundary
might be reported as two events.

<p>A scan query uses command <tt>scan</tt>. The <tt>beginTStamp</tt>
and <tt>endTStamp</tt> integer fields are mandatory and indicate the
time range over which the scan should search for events: <tt>beginTStamp</tt>
is inclusive and <tt>endTStamp</tt> is exclusive. <tt>beginTStamp</tt>
must be less than <tt>endTStamp</tt>. The <tt>map</tt> string field
names the map to be scanned. There is also a <tt>ranges</tt> field
with an array of range objects. Each range object contains integer
<tt>start</tt> and <tt>length</tt> fields describing the virtual
addresses of interest.

<p>By default the query searches for all events in the given time range
that affect memory in any of the given ranges. By specifying an
optional <tt>termination</tt> field the query can be terminated early.
The string value <tt>findFirst</tt> will allow termination as soon as
the first-in-time relevant event has been detected. The string value
<tt>findLast</tt> allows termination as soon as the last-in-time
relevant event has been detected. <tt>findFirstCover</tt>
delays termination until we have reported, for each byte in the range,
the first-in-time event covering that byte. <tt>findLastCover</tt>
delays until we have reported the last-in-time event covering each
bytes. Note that the query agent may return additional events to those
requested before the query terminates.

<p>A scan query produces one result object per relevant event. Each
result object contains a <tt>TStamp</tt> integer field with the
event's timestamp. There are integer <tt>start</tt> and <tt>length</tt>
fields describing the event's affected virtual address range. The
<tt>type</tt> string field is <tt>normal</tt> for a regular access
and <tt>mmap</tt> for a memory-map change that affected the memory.
For <tt>normal</tt> events, MEM_WRITE maps provide a <tt>bytes</tt>
field, a string of 2*<tt>length</tt> hex digits. For <tt>mmap</tt>
events, the <tt>filename</tt> string field contains the filename, if
known, the <tt>offset</tt> integer field contains an offset within
the file, if known, the boolean field <tt>mapped</tt> is set if
the region now corresponds to addressable memory, and the
<tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt> and <tt>execute</tt> boolean fields
contain the read, write and execute permissions. MEM_MAP maps provide
only <tt>mmap</tt> events.

<p>The scan results for any given memory location are ordered in
increasing-time order, except for <tt>findLast</tt> results which
are returned in decreasing-time order. Scan results for non-intersecting
memory areas may be reported in any order.

<p>Every effort is made to catch events but some events may be missing.
For example, some memory reads by the kernel may not be detected.

<h3>Counting Scan Results</h3>

<p>A scan-count query uses command <tt>scanCount</tt>. The <tt>beginTStamp</tt>
and <tt>endTStamp</tt> integer fields are mandatory and indicate the
time range over which the scan should search for events: <tt>beginTStamp</tt>
is inclusive and <tt>endTStamp</tt> is exclusive. <tt>beginTStamp</tt>
must be less than <tt>endTStamp</tt>. The <tt>map</tt> string field
names the map to be scanned. There is also an <tt>address</tt> integer field
specifying a single byte for which events should be counted. The result
includes the number of "normal" events in a single integer field
<tt>count</tt>, unless MEM_MAP was specified, in which case the number of
"mmap" events is returned. (The "number of results" is not well defined when
the input range is broken into many ranges internally, which is why this
query only takes a single byte.)

<h2>Debug Information</h2>

<h3>Identifiers</h3>

<p>Functions, variables and types can have identifiers. The following fields can appear:
<ul>
<li><tt>name</tt>: the name of the object as it appears in a source file.
<li><tt>containerPrefix</tt>: a prefix identifying a type containing the
object.
<li><tt>namespacePrefix</tt>: a prefix identifying a namespace containing
the type or object.
</ul>
Concatenating namespacePrefix, containerPrefix and name, or just
containerPrefix and name, will always give something meaningful. For example,
the C++ method std::string::length() will have name "length",
containerPrefix "string::", and namespacePrefix "std::".

Identifiers can also have a <tt>synthetic</tt> boolean field; if present
and true, it indicates that the function or variable was not declared in
any source file but was generated by the compiler.

<h3>Compilation Units</h3>

Functions and variables can expose information about their compilation unit.
The following fields can appear:
<ul>
<li><tt>compilationUnit</tt>: a string identifying the compilation unit,
usually the full or relative source path of the primary source file for
the compilation unit.
<li><tt>compilationUnitDir</tt>: a string identifying the path to
which <tt>compilationUnit</tt> is relative.
<li><tt>language</tt>: a string identifying the source language, one of
  <ul>
  <li><tt>Ada83</tt>
  <li><tt>Ada95</tt>
  <li><tt>C</tt>
  <li><tt>C89</tt>
  <li><tt>C99</tt>
  <li><tt>C++</tt>
  <li><tt>Cobol74</tt>
  <li><tt>Cobol85</tt>
  <li><tt>D</tt>
  <li><tt>Fortran77</tt>
  <li><tt>Fortran90</tt>
  <li><tt>Fortran95</tt>
  <li><tt>Java</tt>
  <li><tt>Modula2</tt>
  <li><tt>ObjC</tt>
  <li><tt>ObjC++</tt>
  <li><tt>Pascal83</tt>
  <li><tt>PLI</tt>
  <li><tt>UPC</tt>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Autocomplete</h3>

<p>The command <tt>autocomplete</tt> obtains a list of global
symbols matching a given prefix. The <tt>prefix</tt> field contains
the desired prefix. If the optional <tt>caseSenstitive</tt> field is 'true',
then the match is case-sensitive, otherwise it is case-insensitive
(using ASCII case-conversion only; non-ASCII characters are not
considered to have case). The optional <tt>desiredCount</tt> field
specifies a maximum number of results to return. The optional
<tt>from</tt> field gives a number of results that should be ignored
before starting to ignore results. In conjunction with <tt>desiredCount</tt>
this allows the list to be incrementally retrieved, which is important
because large projects may have millions of symbols starting with
a given character. The optional <tt>kinds</tt> field specifies an array
of strings, a subset of "variable", "function" and "type"; if present, matches
are limited to the given kinds of symbols.

<p>Each result value specifies a possible completion. Each value contains
a <tt>name</tt> field giving the full (case-preserved) human-readable name of
the symbol (as stored in DWARF2 <tt>.debug.pubnames</tt> or
<tt>.debug.pubtypes</tt>). There is also a <tt>kind</tt> field containing
one of the strings "variable", "function" or "type". A result value may also
contain a <tt>totalMatches</tt> integer field which gives an
<em>estimate</em> of the total number of matches for the given prefix and
kinds (independent of how many results have been returned or the values of
<tt>desiredCount</tt> and <tt>from</tt>).

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>Some queries return <em>variable objects</em>. These objects describe
variables, including local variables, parameters, and global variables.
A variable object does not contain type or value information, but it provides
keys that allow types and values to be retrieved with via queries.

<p>Variable objects can have identifier fields.
(The name may be missing since variables can be anonymous.) There
can be a string <tt>typeKey</tt> field identifying the type of the variable.
There will be a string <tt>valKey</tt> field that enables one to retrieve the
value of the variable (in conjunction with a timestamp).
Global variable objects have compilation unit fields.

<p>The command <tt>getParameters</tt> takes an integer <tt>TStamp</tt>.
Each result is a variable object representing a formal parameter of
the function executing at that time. The results are returned in the
order in which the parameters are declared (perhaps implicitly, such
as the the 'this' parameter in C++).

<p>The command <tt>getLocals</tt> takes an integer <tt>TStamp</tt>
and returns result variable objects, one for each local variable of
the currently executing function that is in scope at time
TStamp.

<p>The command <tt>getLocation</tt> takes an integer <tt>TStamp</tt>,
a string <tt>valKey</tt> and a string <tt>typeKey</tt>. It returns
a number of results, each describing a "piece" of the value. It may
return no results if the variable is out of scope at time TStamp.

<p>Note that if the function invocation for a local variable or
parameter is not running at time TStamp (i.e., not at the bottom of
the stack) then the variable or parameter is out of scope. To
retrieve values from caller functions, choose a TStamp where the
caller function was active.

<p>Each result object contains a string <tt>type</tt> field: one of "memory",
"register", "constant", "undefined", or "error". Each result object can contain
integer fields <tt>valueBitStart</tt> and <tt>bitLength</tt> denoting
which bit-field of the value is being described. (If valueBitStart is
not present, then type is one of "memory" or "register", and the result
does not contribute directly to the value, but the value does depend
on the specified memory or register.) If bitLength is zero then
this is used as "the rest" of the data. "memory" results
contain integer <tt>address</tt> and <tt>addressBitOffset</tt> fields
describing the virtual address contribution to the value. "register"
results contain string <tt>register</tt> field and an integer
<tt>registerBitOffset</tt> field describing the register contribution to
the value; registerBitOffset is the bit offset from the least-significant
end. "constant" results contain a string <tt>data</tt> field
containing the actual data, in hex.

<p>"undefined" results indicate that all or part of the value is not
available in the program state, usually because it has been
optimized away. "error" results indicate that evaluating location
of this part of the value was impossible in the given program
state (for example, it required deferencing of a null pointer).

<p>One of the result ojects may also contain an array of range objects
in field <tt>validForInstructions</tt>. If present, then the value
locations are valid during the lifetime of this function invocation
as long as none of the mentioned registers or memory change, and the
program counter remains inside the union of the ranges. If not
present then the value locations are valid during the lifetime of
the function invocation as long as none of the mentioned registers
or memory change. With this information it is possible to efficiently
search through time for changes to local variables or parameters.

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Some queries return <em>function objects</em>. A function object
contains <tt>beginTStamp</tt> and <tt>endTStamp</tt> fields identifying the
lifetime of the function (i.e. when its executable file was loaded/unloaded),
and an <tt>entryPoint</tt> integer field giving the
virtual address of the entry point to the function. There can also be a string
<tt>typeKey</tt> giving the type of the function. There can also be
a <tt>ranges</tt> object array field giving a list of virtual memory regions
(in the standard start/length format) occupied by the function's code.
Function objects can contain identifier fields (there may be no name, since
functions can be anonymous). There can be compilation unit fields.
There can be a <tt>prologueEnd</tt> integer field containing an address
where the function prologue has ended and parameter values are readable.

<p>The command <tt>lookupGlobalFunctions</tt> returns the global functions
with a given name. The <tt>name</tt> string field contains the desired name,
fully qualified with namespace and container as necessary,
which is matched case-sensitively against all global symbols. Each global
function is returned as a function object in a distinct query result.

<p>The command <tt>findContainingFunction</tt> returns a global
function containing a given address at a particular time. The
<tt>address</tt> integer field contains the address of interest, and the
<tt>TStamp</tt> integer field contains the timestamp. At most one
result object will be returned; it is a function object in the same
format as for <tt>lookupGlobalFunctions</tt>. In some cases we
do not know exactly the memory regions occupied by a function, so we
may have to guess; when the provided address is not in any function,
we may incorrectly return a function anyway.

<h3>Types</h3>

<p>Types are treated as trees. Because types can be recursive and it's also
useful to lazily load type information, the debugger deals with typeKeys,
which are string identifiers for types. These are not unique; the same
underlying type may have many different typeKeys.

<p>Type information objects can have identifier fields, although many
types are anonymous. Type objects have a <tt>kind</tt> field with one
of the following values:
<ul>
<li>"annotation": the type is a const, volatile or restrict modifier of some other type
<li>"pointer": a type of pointers to some other type
<li>"int": an integral base type
<li>"float": a floating point base type
<li>"enum": a user-defined enumerated value
<li>"typedef": an alias for another type
<li>"struct": a record containing fields (subsumes classes and unions)
<li>"array": an array of some other type
<li>"function": a function type
</ul>

<p>"annotation", "pointer", "typedef", and "array" types have a string
<tt>innerTypeKey</tt> field containing the typekey for the type they
refer to. Pointer types may have no innerTypeKey, meaning it's a pointer to void.

<p>"annotation" types have a string <tt>annotation</tt> field indicating how they modify
the underlying type. The value can be "const", "volatile" or "restrict".

<p>"pointer" types may have a boolean <tt>isReference</tt> field; if true, then this
pointer type is syntactically a C++-style reference.

<p>"int", "float", "enum" and "struct" types have
an integer <tt>byteSize</tt> field containing the size of an instance
of the type, in bytes, if it were in memory, padding included. Bit-sized types are not
supported except for bit-sized struct fields, which are described under
structs.

<p>"int" types may have a boolean <tt>signed</tt> field; if true the type is
signed, otherwise it is unsigned (default unsigned).

<p>"enum" types have a field <tt>values</tt>; this field contains an array of objects.
Each object has an integer <tt>value</tt> field and a string <tt>name</tt> field.

<p>"array" types can have an integer field <tt>length</tt>, giving the number of elements in the
array. If not present, the length is not known. If present, the size is "length" times the
size of the size of the element type.

<p>"function" types can have a field <tt>resultTypeKey</tt> containing the result type key.
There can also be an array field <tt>parameters</tt> containing an array of parameter objects.
Each parameter object can have a <tt>typeKey</tt> string field and/or identifier fields.

<p>"enum" and "struct" types can have a boolean field <tt>partial</tt>; if true, the values
or fields of the type are not known in this compilation unit. The debugger may have to call
lookupGlobalType to get the fields.

<p>"struct" types have a field <tt>structKind</tt> with string values "struct",
"class" or "union" to indicate how the type was declared. There can also be a field
<tt>fields</tt> containing an array of field objects. Each field object can have a <tt>name</tt>
string field (not always present because fields can be anonymous). There can be a
<tt>synthetic</tt> boolean field set to true if the field does not correspond to a
declaration in the source program. A field object
always has a <tt>byteOffset</tt> integer field giving the offset of the field from
the start of the struct. For bit-fields there will be a <tt>byteSize</tt> integer field,
a <tt>bitOffset</tt> integer field, and a <tt>bitSize</tt> integer field. "byteOffset" and
"byteSize" specify a native integer field, and "bitOffset" and "bitSize" specify a bit range
within that field. Each field object has a <tt>typeKey</tt> field giving its type. A
field object can have an <tt>isSubobject</tt> boolean field; if true, then the field represents
a subobject inherited from a parent type.

<p>A type information object can have a <tt>dynamic</tt> boolean field; if true, then
extra information (e.g., extra fields representing C++ virtual base class subobjects,
or an array length) may be available if the type is inspected in conjunction with
runtime data by "lookupTypeDynamic".

<p>With C++ templates, type information objects represent fully instantiated template instances.
The type's "name" field will contain the complete name including an encoding of the template
parameters.

<p>The command <tt>lookupGlobalType</tt> finds a complete (non-partial) global type
with a given name. The <tt>name</tt> string field contains the desired name,
including template parameters.
String <tt>containerPrefix</tt> and <tt>namespacePrefix</tt> fields can be
provided. The name and prefixes are matched case-sensitively against global type names.
Note that the same name could map to different types with different structure --- or
no type at all. There can be a <tt>typeKey</tt> string field; if present, we look for a
type with the requested name in the same context as the typeKey: first in the
same compilation unit, and then in the same object file, then globally.
If there is no matching type, then we just return no result object. The result
object, if any, contains a <tt>typeKey</tt> field giving the unambiguous typekey
of a type.

<p>The command <tt>lookupType</tt> takes a string <tt>typeKey</tt> field
parameter and returns series of result types object with the information about
that type and related types. Information about the requested type is always
returned if available, and the query agent sends back information about
types that it thinks the debugger will also need, as an optimization to
reduce the number of roundtrips required. Each result type object contains
a <tt>typeKey</tt> field indicating which type the information is for.

<p>The command <tt>lookupMethods</tt> takes a string <tt>typeKey</tt> field
parameter and returns a series of (possibly zero) function objects. These
are functions that are considered to be methods of the type. Each function object
can have an extra boolean field <tt>static</tt>; if true, then the function
is considered a static member.

<p>The command <tt>lookupTypeDynamic</tt> takes a string <tt>typeKey</tt> field,
an integer <tt>TStamp</tt> field, and either a string <tt>valKey</tt> field
and an integer <tt>bitOffset</tt> field, or an integer <tt>address</tt> field.
It computes type information in conjunction with runtime data. When "lookupType"
returns a type with "dynamic" set to true, then this command can return additional
data.

<p><em>The query agent should try to collapse multiple types which are structurally
identical into a single type. This is very important for efficiency when
debug info may contain one type definition for every input object file.</em>

<h3>Source Line Info</h3>

<p>The command <tt>findSourceInfo</tt> finds the source coordinates (if any)
of a set of addresses. Pass in an integer time <tt>TStamp</tt>, and either
an <tt>addresses</tt> array of integer addresses or an <tt>address</tt>
integer address. A series of results is returned; each result
will contain the originating <tt>address</tt>,
a <tt>filename</tt> string field accompanied by 1-based integer
<tt>startLine</tt> and <tt>startColumn</tt> fields. The file name contains all
available directory information, although it may not be a complete path.
Additionally, we may provide a guess at the end of the source element, in the
form of 1-based <tt>endLine</tt> and <tt>endColumn</tt> fields.

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>The command <tt>findSPGreaterThan</tt> takes integer <tt>beginTStamp</tt>
and <tt>endTStamp</tt> fields. It also takes an integer <tt>threshold</tt>
parameter, and a <tt>thread</tt> integer field. It finds the first timestamp
between <tt>beginTStamp</tt> (inclusive) and <tt>endTStamp</tt> (exclusive)
of an instruction <em>after</em> which the SP was greater than the given
threshold and the current thread was <tt>thread</tt>. If no such instruction
exists then no result is returned. The result object contains one integer
field <tt>TStamp</tt>.
